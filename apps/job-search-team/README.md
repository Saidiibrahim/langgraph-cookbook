# Coming Soon...

This is a placeholder for a team of agents that will be used to search for jobs.

Here's what I'm thinking:

- We know the user's job preferences (from resume and cover letter? or database?)
- Team of agents will work together to search for jobs, draft cover letters, and send them to the user via email
- Would be nice for the agents to also draft a resume for the user, but more difficult for now (maybe in the future)
