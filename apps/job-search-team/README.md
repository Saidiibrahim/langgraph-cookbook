# Coming Soon...

This is a placeholder for a team of agents that will be used to search for jobs.

Here's what I'm thinking:

- We know the user's job preferences (from resume and cover letter? or database?)
- Team of agents will work together to search for jobs, draft cover letters, and send them to the user via email
- Would be nice for the agents to also draft a resume for the user, but more difficult for now (maybe in the future)
- Agents will need a way to collaborate with human editors
    - For example, if an agent finds a job that is a good fit, but the job description is missing some important keywords, the human editor can add the keywords to the job description and the agent can use that to draft a new cover letter
    - Maybe both the agent and human editor will share a scratchpad workspace to collaborate on?
