# LangGraph Cookbook

This repository contains a collection of agentic applications using LangGraph. It is a work in progress and will be updated as we add more recipes.

The repo is divided in two parts:

- `apps`: A collection of agentic applications using LangGraph.
      - Each app has its own README with instructions on how to run it.
- `notebooks`: A collection of notebooks used to test and develop the agentic applications.
